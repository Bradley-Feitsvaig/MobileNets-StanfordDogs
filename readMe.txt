We have created a MobileNets model that is capable to classify a breed from an image of a dog among 120 different breeds. Due to a good training process, this model can classify a breed from either young or adult dogs. 
Moreover, 12-15 epochs are sufficient to get a high validation and testing accuracy rates as it can be seen in the model accuracy graph for 30 epochs. 
According to the summary that we generated from our model in the code, our model has 3,329,976 Trainable parameters.
In the end of the training process with 15 epochs, the results were:  loss: 0.0646 - accuracy: 0.9980 - val_loss: 0.9135 - val_accuracy: 0.7364. 
The model we trained in our project is 10 percent less accurate than the compatible model in the article (1.0 MobileNet-224) for Stanford dogs.


how to use the program:

to open the program use GUI.py
note:
spyder doesnt fully support tkinter library,
therefore please run GUI.py using pycharm or anaconda prompt code
**Python 3.6
